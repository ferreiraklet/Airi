## - Usage & Explanation:
  Some Web Applications use forms in order to make it stable. Starting from this principle, is possible that the application handle's hidden inputs in source code
  
  Ex: ```<input type="hidden" name="validate" value="test">```
  
  Here it is when Airi appears,
  
  When Web Environment has an input like ```<input type="hidden" name="test" value="">``` and it's value is 0, is very likely the parameter maybe reflected in front end, in this way, making it probably possible to exploit xss reflected.
  
  EXAMPLE:
  
  ```cat index.html```
  output:
  ```<input type="hidden" name="testing" value="">```
  
  Airi reads from stdin

  You can use a file containing a list of targets as well:
  
  cat targets | airi
  
  
  **Airi only brings to us the url to be tested, so, to test if parameter is reflecting, you can use other tools such as: httpx, kxss, gxss, etc.**
